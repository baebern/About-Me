                    Hello, my name is Bernadette P. Pangilinan, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my website! I was born on November 16, 2005, making me 18 years old. I call Mandile, San Miguel, Bulacan, my home, where I've lived for as long as I can remember. I completed my elementary education at Mandile Elementary School, graduating as the class salutatorian. Since then, I've been fortunate to maintain a consistent record of academic excellence, earning honors every year, including now as a senior high school student. Currently, I'm in grade 12, pursuing the STEM strand at San Miguel National High School. Initially, I had my heart set on becoming a Civil Engineer, but my General Physics score and my Pre-Calculus grade in grade 11 made me reconsider my path. As a result, I've decided to pursue a career in Medical Technology instead. While I may not particularly enjoy math and science, I find myself drawn to courses related to these subjects, which is why I've chosen to pursue a career in a field that intersects with my interests.

                    I enjoy spending most of my time at home, but I also love hanging out with my friends. Experimenting with cooking, especially when it comes to making desserts, brings me joy. Playing volleyball and badminton is something I always look forward to during my free time. I'm really passionate about my studies, and I always strive to do my best to avoid any regrets. Reading books, whether they're physical copies or from Wattpad, is a favorite pastime of mine. Listening to music lifts my spirits and gives me energy. When I'm feeling down, watching movies has become my go-to comfort.

                    I can play the lyre and ukulele. Additionally, I understand a bit of Kapampangan because it's the language spoken by the elderly at home. Crocheting and solving Sudoku puzzles are hobbies I enjoy. I learned to solve a Rubik's Cube just by following the instructions on the box. Traveling to different places is something I love to do. On days with lots of free time, I can finish reading 2-3 books. Loud noise from people annoys me, but loud noise from the surroundings calms me and makes me feel sleepy. I dislike eating soup in the afternoon, and although I'm not a fan of vegetables, I love pumpkin and potato. My favorite book is called "A Gentle Reminder." I adore the colors purple and green, and I have a fondness for rainy days.
